# Lab 1 Summary

## Environment Setup
- GCP Project ID:  mgmt599-pavanmeka-lab1
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/pavankmeka/classResources.git
- Data Lake Bucket:  mgmt599-pavanmeka-data-lake

## Key Findings
1. The Technology category has the highest total sales, significantly outperforming Furniture and Office Supplies.
2. The Central region exhibits significantly lower profitability compared to other regions, despite having moderate sales.
3. The monthly profit trend shows clear seasonality with peaks in Q4 and dips in Q1, indicating predictable business cycles.

## DIVE Analysis Results
- Business Question Investigated: Why is the Central region less profitable than other regions, despite having moderate sales?
- Main Discovery: The Central region's low profitability is strongly correlated with its significantly higher average discount rate compared to other regions, particularly impacting the Furniture and Office Supplies categories.
- Strategic Recommendation: Review and adjust the discounting strategy in the Central region, implement stricter controls on discount levels, and optimize the product mix to promote higher-margin items.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Challenge faced: Interpreting the reason for the Central region's low profitability based solely on initial EDA metrics.
- How I solved it: Applied the DIVE framework to systematically investigate potential factors like discounts and product mix, and used Gemini to interpret the findings and generate hypotheses.
